# hitt

hitt is a HTTP testing tool focused on speed and simplicity.

It started as an alternative to Postman since I was tired of Postman taking a long time to open (on my machine).

## Disclaimer

hitt is most likely not ready for main stream usage. I ([Mads Hougesen](https://mhouge.dk)) am primarily developing it based on features I believe to be useful, or fun to develop.
